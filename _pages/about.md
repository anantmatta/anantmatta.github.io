My name is Anant Matta, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign 
studying Mathematics and Computer Science. This website is still under construction, so I apologize for any issues in advance.

I'm currently working with the [Wireless, Sensing, & Embedded Networked Systems](https://isens.cs.illinois.edu) (iSENS) Lab to develop real-time visulizations of wireless communications using miXed Reality.

Outside of academia, I'm passionate about 3D printing and precision machines. Feel free to check out some of my 
[current and past projects](anantmatta.github.io/projects/)!
