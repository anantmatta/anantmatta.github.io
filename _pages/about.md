My name is Anant Matta, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana - Champaign (UIUC)
studying Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm expecting to graduate in the spring of 2025.

I currently work as a researcher at the [Wireless, Sensing, & Embedded Networked Systems](https://isens.cs.illinois.edu) (iSENS) Lab to develop real-time visulizations of wireless signals using miXed Reality (XR).

Outside of academia, I'm passionate about 3D printing and developing precision machines. I'm still in the process of updating this website, so be on the lookout for some of my [current and past projects](anantmatta.github.io/projects/).
